TODO: download and explore the copernicus data for sea surface height anomalies: 
https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data/copernicus-services-catalogue/global-ocean-along-track-l3-sea-surface-heights

TODO: create a new branch dev in the repository

TODO: in the dev branch:
   - create a new directory in the git repo: altSshValidation, where Ssh stands for sea surface height
   - add an empty file __init__.py
   - implement a module/function coarsenCmemsSshSatData.py similar to altHsValidation.coarsenSatData, but elaborates the copernicus data of ssh of CMEMS.
     - the objective of this function is to coarsen and smooth the satellite data.
     - this functin should create a npy file for each satellite/year, with name SSH_SATELLITENAME_year.npy, e.g. SSH_Jason-1_2005.npy
     - each file contains a Nx4 numpy array, with these columns:
         - time stamp (created with the function datetime.timestamp(avgtm), see lines 106, 111 of the module coarsenData)
         - lon
         - lat
         - value of ssh
     - the input parameters of the function should be similar to the one of coarsenSatData: 
            rootdir: dir where the CMEMS data are placed, 
            outputdir: dir where the output npy files will be placed, 
            startdate, enddate
            latdelta: this indicates a latitudinal distance over which the data are aggregated, say this is 0.5degs, this means that one output record is produced every 0.5 latitude degrees along the satellite tracks.
            areaRectangles: rectangles (optional) identifying subareas of interest (apparently now handles correctly only 1 rectangle)

     - the logics which produce the aggregation are the same as in coarsenSatData (see lines 78-118): divide the data by
