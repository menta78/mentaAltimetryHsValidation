TODO Lorenzo: download the data from https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/product-detail/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L3_MY_008_062/DATA-ACCESS and check that everything works for you as well

TODO Guille: you can find some model output to carry on the work here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6dzfrk23pheenwe/AADxZhnzhxAzpSwu2y-UtHc3a?dl=0

TODO Guille: remove the mean from observations and measurements before computing the model skills

TODO Guille: limit the estimation of the skills on SSH to pairs observation-model where both are beyond their respective 90th percentiles.

TODO Guille: as an indicator for SSH skill compute the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash%E2%80%93Sutcliffe_model_efficiency_coefficient) also called R2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) 

TODO Guille: the module altSshValidation.coarsenCmemsSshSatData should be able to hanlde all the directories of the CMEMS dataset along track, as each directory corresponds to a different mission (see the dataset documentation, at section VI.1.2)

TODO Guille: in computeSshStats.py remove commented source code where it is not necessary

TODO Guille: in computeSshStats.py, between lines 216 and 244, handle the new architecture (you can also comment the code and throw a "unsupported" exception)

TODO Guille: review the computeStats.py module for Hs, giving it the same architecture of computeSshStats.py (so that it will be possible to estimate the percentiles)
